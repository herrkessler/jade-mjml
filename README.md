# gulp jade mjml

### use mjml with pug (if you're too lazy to write any html / mjml... just as I am :-)

## Getting Started

To use the code [download it](https://github.com/herrkessler/pug-mjmlarchive/master.zip), or clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/herrkessler/pug-mjml
```

install dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev
```

## Do The Things

Simply run GULP and there's your mjml email template:

```bash
gulp
```
